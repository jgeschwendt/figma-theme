Generate development-ready theme JSON files from Figma Styles. Forked from [jxnblk/figma-theme](https://github.com/jxnblk/figma-theme)) by Brent Jackson.

- Parse [Styles][] from a Figma file ID
- Works with [Styled System][] and other CSS-in-JS setups
- Built with [figma-js][]

```sh
npm i figma-theme
```

## Getting Started

1. Install `figma-theme` as a dev dependency in your project
2. Get a [personal access token][token] for the Figma API
3. Create a `.env` file with your access token
  - `FIGMA_TOKEN=<personal-access-token>`
  - Alternatively add an environment variable for `FIGMA_TOKEN`
4. Add an npm run script: `figma-theme <figma-file-id>`
5. Run the script to create a `theme.json` file based on Figma Styles

## Options

Options can be passed as CLI flags or included in a `figma-theme` object in your `package.json`

- `--out-dir`: output directory (default current working directory)
- `--metadata`: include additional metadata from the Figma API
